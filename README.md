# Widthit Js
A powerful and light weighted javascript plugin for responsive design
<br>
<br>
created as a great plugin for subtituting items in a html document in respect to the width and height of any device. Width it works in the sense that it technically does not enable you  create a grid system as other popular responsive tools like bootstrap, it does enable you shedule different designs for different devices easily. 

it is built on javascript and extends jQuery and works in any element in html
